## ðŸ“‹ Requirements

Seeing as React Native apps may target iOS 11.0 and Android 5.0 (API 21) or newer, this should beb the standardized mobile OS requirements when interacting with the myHealth product.

## ðŸ“– Documentation

The full documentation for myHealth can be found on the main branch of our GitHub repository.

## ðŸš€ Upgrading

Upgrading to new versions of myHealth will allow for interaction with the latest features implemented into myHealth.

## CSUSB Software Engineers

This entire project is being developed using Facebook's React Native tool in order to develop an application that supports both major mobile operating systems. Uploaded to this repository are all React Native files for the myHealth application EXCLUDING the 'node-modules' folder as that is to be maintained locally on your development environment. After setting up your development environment, please proceed to create a blank project named 'myHealth' and search for the directory it created. Replace the files, with the ones from the repository and test in order to confirm we are all setup.
